### Description

Produces a rendered 3d image from a 2d bitmap. Allows the user to rotate the image, or animate it & also change the height scale.

Really easy code, produces some great effects, works best wwith 256 * 256 pixel greyscale images(I've included some to play with), but also produces some quite bizarre effects with any .bmp or .jpg.

I did a sort of clumsy version of this a while back, but this is completely rewritten.

Uses Raul Fragoso's rotating image routine Submitted on: 3/12/2002, thanks Raul for that one.

Have fun.
